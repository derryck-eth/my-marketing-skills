# Email Sequence

## Purpose

This skill enables you to design and execute email sequences that guide prospects through the buyer's journey—from awareness to decision to loyalty. Email sequences are multi-email campaigns sent over days or weeks with a specific goal: welcome new subscribers, launch a product, nurture leads, re-engage dormant customers, or drive specific actions. A well-designed sequence builds trust, overcomes objections, and increases conversion rates by 3-5x compared to single emails.

## When to Use

- **Welcome/Onboarding Sequences** (3-7 emails): New email subscribers; introduce your brand, set expectations, and deliver promised lead magnet
- **Product Launch Sequences** (5-8 emails): Announce and sell a new product; build anticipation, overcome objections, create urgency
- **Lead Nurture Sequences** (ongoing, 2-4 emails/week): Deliver value to engaged prospects; educate, build credibility, and move them closer to purchase
- **Re-engagement Sequences** (3-4 emails): Win back inactive subscribers before removing them from list
- **Post-Purchase/Onboarding** (3-5 emails): Set up new customers for success; reduce churn, drive feature adoption, encourage reviews
- **Webinar Follow-up** (3-5 emails): Convert webinar attendees into customers after the event
- **Abandoned Cart** (2-3 emails): Recover lost sales from e-commerce or SaaS trials
- **Upsell/Cross-sell Sequences** (2-4 emails): Move customers to higher-tier products or complementary services

## Core Frameworks

### Welcome/Onboarding Sequence (3-7 emails)
**Goal**: Build initial trust, deliver promised value, warm up prospect

| Email # | Send Timing | Focus | Goal |
|---------|-------------|-------|------|
| 1 (Welcome) | Immediate | Warm introduction + deliver lead magnet | Build trust; set tone |
| 2 | Day 2-3 | Story + pain point validation | Deepen emotional connection |
| 3 | Day 4-5 | Deliver value (free resource, tip, case study) | Demonstrate expertise |
| 4 | Day 6-7 | Introduce product/service softly | Plant seed; no hard sell |
| 5 (Optional) | Day 8-10 | Address common objection or fear | Reduce friction |
| 6 (Optional) | Day 12-14 | Social proof + testimonial | Build credibility |
| 7 (Optional) | Day 16-21 | Final value-add or soft CTA | Keep option open |

**Email 1 Template**: Welcome + Lead Magnet Delivery
- Subject: Warm, personal ("Welcome to [Community Name]!")
- Body: Introduce yourself; explain what they're getting; deliver link immediately; set expectations ("You'll get emails on [frequency/day]")
- CTA: "Grab your guide" or "Get started"

**Email 2 Template**: Story + Relatability
- Subject: Pattern interrupt or curiosity ("Why I started [company]" or "The #1 mistake I made")
- Body: Tell personal story; relate to their pain; hint at solution
- CTA: Soft; introduce next email or ask them to reply

**Email 3 Template**: Value Delivery
- Subject: Benefit-focused ("3 Tactics to [Outcome]")
- Body: Deliver actionable content; prove you know their problem
- CTA: Introduce your product/service lightly ("Learn how we help [audience]")

### Product Launch Sequence (5-8 emails)
**Goal**: Build anticipation, overcome objections, convert to customers

| Email # | Send Timing | Focus | Goal |
|---------|-------------|-------|------|
| 1 (Teaser) | Day 1 | Curiosity + pattern interrupt | Build anticipation; get opens |
| 2 (Reveal) | Day 2-3 | Introduce product + core benefit | Show what it is; why it matters |
| 3 (Social Proof) | Day 4-5 | Testimonials, beta results, case study | Build credibility; reduce doubt |
| 4 (Objection Handling) | Day 6-7 | Address common objections (price, fit, complexity) | Remove friction |
| 5 (FOMO/Scarcity) | Day 8-10 | Limited-time offer, limited spots, discount ending | Create urgency |
| 6 (Final Call) | Day 11-13 | Last chance language; last opportunity to buy | Capitalize on interest |
| 7 (Post-Launch) | Day 14+ | Post-mortem; "Here's what happened"; offer remains open (softer) | Keep the door open |

**Key Rules**:
- Email 1: Curiosity-driven subject line; don't reveal product yet; focus on problem ("Something's changing…")
- Email 2: Hero shot and core benefit; make it visual; clear positioning ("We built X so you can Y")
- Email 3: Real results (numbers, testimonials, case study); third-party credibility
- Email 4: Anticipate objections ("You might be wondering about X…"); provide honest answer + risk reversal
- Email 5: Scarcity element (limited-time discount, limited seats, exclusive access); countdown if possible
- Email 6: "This is the last email" honesty; final CTA; urgency language ("After tomorrow, this offer closes")

### Lead Nurture Sequence (Ongoing)
**Goal**: Keep engaged prospects warm; provide value; move toward sale over weeks/months

**Cadence**: 2-4 emails per week; content-heavy, sales-light

**Email Types** (rotate):
- **Educational**: Teach a skill, share a tactic, deliver a resource ("The 5-Step Framework to X")
- **Social Proof**: Share a win, customer story, or case study ("How [Company] Achieved [Result]")
- **Objection Clearing**: Address concerns ("Do you really need an agency?" or "Isn't this too expensive?")
- **Insight/Perspective**: Share industry insight, trend analysis, or contrarian take
- **Soft Sale**: Introduce your product/service in low-pressure way ("We built this for people like you")
- **Engagement**: Ask questions, poll, invite reply ("What's your biggest challenge with X?")

**Segmentation**: Segment by company size, role, interests, or engagement level; send different content to different segments

### Re-engagement Sequence (3-4 emails)
**Goal**: Win back inactive subscribers; clear out unengaged list

| Email # | Send Timing | Focus | Goal |
|---------|-------------|-------|------|
| 1 (Curiosity) | Day 1 | Gentle nudge + curiosity hook ("We miss you…") | Get re-open |
| 2 (Value Reminder) | Day 3-4 | Remind them of value you provided; offer resource | Demonstrate ongoing relevance |
| 3 (Final Offer) | Day 7-10 | Limited-time offer or exclusive content | Entice back one last time |
| 4 (Goodbye) | Day 14 | "We're removing you" + option to stay | Clean up list; final re-engagement attempt |

## Subject Line Formulas (High-Converting)

### Curiosity-Driven
- "One thing I wish I knew [time period] ago"
- "[Name], you're missing out (and here's why)"
- "You've been doing this wrong (probably)"
- "The [outcome] secret nobody talks about"

### Benefit-Driven
- "[Specific #] ways to [outcome] in [timeframe]"
- "Finally—how to [solve pain] without [objection]"
- "Get [result] by [method]"
- "The formula we use to [get result]"

### Pattern Interrupt / FOMO
- "This changes everything"
- "Doors close tomorrow"
- "Only 3 spots left"
- "You're invited (but not everyone is)"
- "[Name]—[Personalization] made me think of you"

### Question-Based
- "What if you could [huge benefit]?"
- "Tired of [pain]?"
- "Why [specific audience] chooses [solution]?"

### Social Proof / Numbers
- "[#] X achieved [result] this quarter"
- "47 [audience] secrets revealed"
- "#1 reason [outcome] fails"

**Subject Line Rules**:
- **Keep under 50 characters** (mobile optimization)
- **Personalization**: Use first name if available ("Sarah, you need to see this")
- **Test 3 variations**: A/B test at least 3 subject lines per campaign
- **Avoid spam triggers**: "Free," "Act now," "Guarantee," "Work from home"
- **Create curiosity gap**: Tease benefit but don't fully reveal

## Email Body Rules

### Opening Line
- **Hook immediately**: Lead with benefit, problem, story, or curiosity (first line is crucial)
- **Use conversational tone**: Write like you're texting a friend; use contractions ("you're" not "you are")
- **Short first line**: 1-3 words or 1 short sentence; create white space

### Body Structure
- **Lead with the benefit**: First paragraph should answer "Why should I read this?"
- **Keep sentences short**: 5-12 words as target; break up text into single-line paragraphs
- **Use bullet points sparingly**: Only for lists of 3+ items; too many bullets make emails feel salesy
- **Tell micro-stories**: Brief (2-3 sentence) anecdotes are more engaging than data
- **Build one idea per email**: Cover one topic; don't try to say everything at once
- **Use white space aggressively**: Lots of paragraph breaks; short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

### Email Length
- **Welcome/nurture emails**: 100-250 words (conversational, brief)
- **Educational emails**: 250-400 words (value-heavy, longer acceptable)
- **Sales/launch emails**: 150-350 words (focused on CTA; don't oversell)
- **Rule of thumb**: Shorter is better; if email exceeds 400 words, consider breaking into 2 emails

### CTA Placement & Optimization
- **Primary CTA location**: End of email (after you've built value)
- **Secondary CTA (optional)**: After main benefit statement (for high-intent readers)
- **Avoid multiple CTAs**: Stick to one primary call-to-action per email
- **CTA formula**: First-person action verb + specific outcome + risk-reducer
  - "Get my 5-step framework" (not "Click here")
  - "Start your free trial" (not "Learn more")
  - "Claim your free consultation" (includes risk-reducer)
- **CTA button vs. link**: Both work; buttons stand out; links feel natural in text
- **Test CTA copy**: A/B test button text ("Start free trial" vs. "Try for free" vs. "Get started now")

## Sending Cadence & Timing

- **Welcome sequence**: Send daily or every 2 days (subscribers are warm)
- **Product launch**: Every 2-3 days while launch window is open (5-8 emails over 2-3 weeks)
- **Nurture sequence**: 2-4 emails per week (maintain engagement without overwhelming)
- **Re-engagement**: Every 3-5 days for 2-3 weeks (final opportunity to reconnect)
- **Best send times**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8 AM-10 AM local time (test and adjust based on your audience)

## Automation & Segmentation

### Triggers (Automated Sequences)
- **Signup**: Auto-send welcome sequence
- **Lead magnet download**: Auto-send follow-up sequence
- **Demo request**: Auto-send educational/sales sequence
- **Purchase**: Auto-send onboarding sequence
- **Inactivity**: Auto-send re-engagement sequence after 60-90 days no open/click
- **Webinar attendance**: Auto-send follow-up sequence

### Segmentation (Send Different Sequences to Different Groups)
- **By role**: Founders vs. managers vs. individual contributors
- **By company size**: Startup vs. SMB vs. Enterprise
- **By industry**: Tech vs. healthcare vs. ecommerce
- **By engagement**: Highly engaged vs. moderate vs. low
- **By behavior**: Product features used, pages visited, stage in journey
- **By interests**: Topic clicked on, download selected, webinar attended

**Rule**: Segment when you have 1,000+ subscribers and distinct audience segments; otherwise, one sequence serves most

## Process

### 1. Define the Goal
- What action do you want subscribers to take? (Purchase, book demo, download resource, attend webinar)
- What is the decision point? (When should they be ready to decide?)
- What is success? (# conversions, % conversion rate, engagement rate)

### 2. Map the Sequence
- Determine email count (welcome = 3-7; launch = 5-8; nurture = ongoing)
- Map send schedule (day 1, day 3, day 5, etc.)
- Outline the core message for each email (one idea per email)
- Identify key milestones (when do you introduce product? When do you ask for the sale?)

### 3. Write Each Email
- **Email 1**: Hook hard; build trust; deliver promised value
- **Middle emails**: Alternate value delivery and soft sales; tell stories; use social proof
- **Final email(s)**: Make the clear CTA; create urgency; be direct
- Follow the email body rules: conversational tone, short paragraphs, specific CTAs

### 4. Add Automation & Triggers
- Set up email sequence in your ESP (ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp, etc.)
- Assign trigger (signup, lead magnet download, etc.)
- Map segmentation if needed (different sequences for different segments)
- Set sending cadence (timing of each email)

### 5. Review & Test
- Proofread for typos, spelling, broken links
- Test on mobile and desktop
- Preview subject lines and preview text
- A/B test subject lines and CTA copy
- Monitor open rates, click rates, and conversions
- Iterate and improve based on data
