## Core Frameworks & Knowledge

### Content Pillars
- **Definition**: 3-5 core themes that define your brand's content authority
- **Example pillars for SaaS productivity tool**: Productivity Workflows, Team Collaboration, Work-Life Balance, Best Practices, Industry Trends
- **Why they matter**: Keep content focused, ensure consistency, make team scaling easier
- **How to identify**: Overlap between (a) what your audience cares about, (b) what you're expert in, (c) what drives business goals

### Content Types & Formats
- **Blog posts**: SEO-driven, thought leadership, how-tos (600-2,500 words)
- **Video content**: YouTube tutorials, explainer videos, testimonials, behind-the-scenes (1-10 minutes)
- **Podcasts**: Interview series, industry commentary, storytelling (30-60 minutes)
- **Social media**: Platform-specific formats (LinkedIn articles, Twitter threads, Instagram carousels)
- **Whitepapers/Guides**: Deep dives, research reports (3,000+ words)
- **Case studies**: Real customer results, implementation details, ROI proof
- **Webinars**: Educational, interactive, lead magnets

### Keyword-Driven Content Planning
- **Research**: Use SEO tools (Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz) to identify keyword opportunities
- **Intent matching**: Map keywords to buyer journey stage (awareness, consideration, decision)
- **Content gap analysis**: Find keywords competitors rank for but you don't
- **Topic clusters**: Create pillar content (comprehensive) + cluster content (specific keywords linking back)
- **Search volume vs. difficulty**: Balance high-volume keywords with lower-competition opportunities
- **User intent**: "How-to" content for informational intent, comparison posts for consideration, product pages for transactional

### Editorial Calendar Strategy
- **12-month planning**: Align with business goals, product launches, industry events
- **Content batching**: Batch similar content (e.g., write 5 blog posts in one session)
- **Lead time planning**: Allow 2-4 weeks for blog production, 6-8 weeks for video
- **Distribution scheduling**: Plan when/where each piece goes across channels
- **Review cycles**: Build in review/approval time before publishing
- **Flexibility**: Keep 20% of calendar open for trending topics and reactive content

### Content Repurposing Framework
One piece of long-form content can become:
- Blog post → LinkedIn article + Twitter thread + Email newsletter
- Video → Blog post transcript + Podcast episode + Quote graphics
- Webinar → YouTube video + Blog series + Lead magnet + Email sequence
- Research report → Infographic + Social carousel + Press release + Podcast episode
- Case study → Blog post + Video testimonial + Email series + LinkedIn article

### Distribution Strategy
- **Owned channels**: Email list, blog, website, podcast feed (highest ROI)
- **Earned channels**: Organic search, backlinks, media mentions, shares (highest credibility)
- **Paid channels**: LinkedIn ads, Google ads, content syndication (fastest scale)
- **Partner channels**: Guest posts, co-marketing, influencer sharing (leverage)
- **Community channels**: Twitter, Reddit, Slack communities, forums (authentic)
- **Distribution timing**: Publish when your audience is most active (varies by platform)

### Content Scoring & Performance Metrics
- **Traffic quality**: Organic vs paid, new vs returning, bounce rate, time on page
- **Engagement**: Comments, shares, backlinks, mentions
- **Lead quality**: Form submissions, demo requests, email signups from content
- **Revenue impact**: Track which content pieces contribute to sales
- **Evergreen value**: Some content generates traffic for years; some is time-sensitive
- **Content ROI formula**: (Revenue attributed - Content cost) / Content cost × 100

### Content Gap Analysis
- **Audit existing content**: Map all pieces to buyer journey + keywords
- **Identify white spaces**: Topics you don't cover that competitors do
- **Customer research**: What questions do prospects ask that you're not answering?
- **Search data**: Keywords with high traffic you don't rank for
- **Plan additions**: Prioritize gaps by traffic opportunity + business impact

## Process (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Strategy & Planning (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Define business goals**: What do you want content to achieve? (leads, brand awareness, thought leadership, organic traffic)
2. **Identify audience**: Create buyer personas with their pain points, questions, and preferred content formats
3. **Research competition**: Analyze top 5-10 competitors' content strategies—what topics do they own? Where are gaps?
4. **Define content pillars**: Create 3-5 core themes that blend audience needs + business goals + your expertise
5. **Set success metrics**: Choose 3-5 KPIs (organic traffic, MQLs, brand mentions, engagement rate)
6. **Audit existing content**: Document all current pieces, map to buyer journey, identify gaps and underperformers

### Phase 2: Research & Planning (Weeks 2-3)
1. **Keyword research**: Use Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz to find 100+ target keywords across your pillars
2. **Cluster keywords**: Group by topic (create content clusters with pillar + cluster content)
3. **Map to buyer journey**: Awareness (research-focused), Consideration (comparison-focused), Decision (product-focused)
4. **Identify content gaps**: Find high-volume keywords you don't rank for or topics competitors own
5. **Content type matching**: Decide which format fits each keyword (blog post, video, guide, comparison, case study)
6. **Resource assessment**: Estimate production time and resources needed

### Phase 3: Editorial Calendar & Planning (Week 3-4)
1. **Create 12-month calendar**: Block content themes by month, align with business calendar
2. **Plan content pillars for each month**: Ensure even distribution across pillars
3. **Identify key dates**: Product launches, industry events, seasonal peaks, company milestones
4. **Define publishing cadence**: How many pieces per week? (Balance: 3-4 blog posts/week is typical for growth-stage companies)
5. **Assign owners & deadlines**: Who writes what? When is first draft due?
6. **Build review/approval process**: Who approves? How long for revisions?

### Phase 4: Content Production
1. **Create detailed briefs**: Title, target keyword, keyword density, outline, desired length, CTA
2. **Set quality standards**: Brand voice guidelines, formatting standards, SEO requirements
3. **Assign to creators**: Internal team or freelancers with clear expectations
4. **Review drafts**: Fact-check, ensure brand voice, optimize for keyword
5. **Revise & finalize**: Incorporate feedback, final copyedit, optimize images
6. **Schedule publication**: Add metadata, optimize title/description, schedule across channels

### Phase 5: Distribution & Amplification
1. **Internal promotion**: Share in company Slack, encourage team sharing
2. **Email marketing**: Send to email list with compelling subject line
3. **Social promotion**: Create platform-specific assets (LinkedIn article, Twitter thread, Instagram carousel)
4. **Paid promotion**: Run LinkedIn, Google, or social ads for highest-impact content
5. **Outreach**: Email relevant people, podcasts, communities
6. **Guest post pitching**: Find publications in your space, pitch complementary content

### Phase 6: Measurement & Optimization (Monthly & Quarterly)
1. **Track metrics**: Monitor organic traffic, leads, engagement, rankings
2. **Content audits**: Which pieces drive results? Which underperform?
3. **ROI analysis**: Connect content pieces to leads and revenue when possible
4. **Update underperformers**: Refresh old content, add new information, improve SEO
5. **Identify winners**: What topics, formats, and distribution methods work best?
6. **Iterate**: Adjust calendar, pillars, and approach based on data
