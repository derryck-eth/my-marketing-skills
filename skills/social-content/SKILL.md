## Core Frameworks & Knowledge

### Platform-Specific Content Best Practices

#### LinkedIn
- **Best For**: B2B, professional services, career advice, industry news, thought leadership
- **Audience**: 930M users; professionals, executives, job seekers (highly engaged)
- **Post Types**: Long-form articles, industry insights, career advice, company updates
- **Optimal Length**: 150-200 characters for social proof; 1,000+ words for long-form articles (native articles rank well)
- **Posting Frequency**: 2-4 times per week (daily risks algorithm suppression)
- **Engagement Drivers**: Controversial takes, personal stories, data/stats, industry predictions
- **Format Success**: Native articles (9x higher engagement), carousels (2nd), text posts (3rd)
- **Hashtag Strategy**: 3-5 niche hashtags (e.g., #MarketingStrategy #B2BLeadGen); LinkedIn algorithm favors niche over broad

#### Twitter/X
- **Best For**: News, commentary, real-time engagement, community building, developer marketing
- **Audience**: 550M users; tech-savvy, news-focused, debate-oriented
- **Post Types**: Threads (stories, tips, threads), takes, retweets with commentary, replies to trending topics
- **Optimal Length**: 280 characters (but threads can be longer)
- **Posting Frequency**: 3-10 times per day (Twitter rewards active accounts; audience checks multiple times daily)
- **Engagement Drivers**: Controversial opinions, valuable tips (threads), real-time commentary on news, relatable humor
- **Format Success**: Threads (high engagement, discoverability), single tweets with media (images drive 35% more engagement), polls
- **Hashtag Strategy**: 1-2 broad hashtags max (discovery); Twitter audience scrolls through feeds, not searching

#### Instagram
- **Best For**: Visual storytelling, lifestyle, product showcase, personal branding, B2C (some B2B)
- **Audience**: 2B users; visual-first, lifestyle-focused, younger demographic (but aging up)
- **Post Types**: Carousel (5-10 images), Reels (short video, 15-90 seconds), Stories (ephemeral, 24 hours)
- **Optimal Length**: Captions: 150-200 characters (sweet spot before "more"); Reels: 15-30 seconds
- **Posting Frequency**: 3-5 times per week (Reels 2-3x weekly for reach); Stories daily
- **Engagement Drivers**: Behind-the-scenes, before/after, user-generated content, Reels (Reels get 67% more reach than static posts)
- **Format Success**: Reels (highest reach), Carousel, Stories (high engagement from followers)
- **Hashtag Strategy**: 20-30 relevant hashtags (spread between captions and 1st comment); mix popular (100K+) and niche (1K-10K)

#### TikTok
- **Best For**: Entertainment, trending audio, younger audience, viral potential, product education (creative)
- **Audience**: 1.6B users; 60% under 24, but growing older; highly engaged, algorithm-driven
- **Post Types**: Short-form video (15-60 seconds), trending sounds/music, challenges, education disguised as entertainment
- **Optimal Length**: 21-34 seconds (sweet spot for retention); longer videos need hook in first 3 seconds
- **Posting Frequency**: 1-3 times per day (algorithm favors frequency; freshness important)
- **Engagement Drivers**: Trending sounds, trending effects, original content, humor, relatability, "watch til end"
- **Format Success**: Trending audio + original hook (highest), before/after or transformation, educational content (creative angle)
- **Hashtag Strategy**: 3-5 hashtags (some trending, some niche); TikTok algorithm doesn't favor hashtags as much as content quality

### Hook Writing & Attention Grabbing

The first 1-3 seconds determines if content is watched or scrolled past.

#### Hook Formulas
1. **Curiosity Gap**
   - "I spent 30 days doing this... here's what happened"
   - "Most people don't know this about [topic]"
   - "Everyone's doing [wrong thing], but actually..."

2. **Bold Statement / Hot Take**
   - "[Conventional wisdom] is wrong"
   - "The best [category] isn't [expected answer], it's..."
   - "Stop [common mistake]; do this instead"

3. **Promise / Benefit**
   - "Save 3 hours per week with this [tactic]"
   - "How to [desired outcome] in [timeframe]"
   - "The #1 reason [problem] isn't [expected cause]"

4. **Pattern Interrupt / Unexpected**
   - "Wait... [unexpected fact]"
   - "I was wrong about [topic]"
   - Contrast image or unexpected statement

5. **Question / Direct Address**
   - "What if [provocative scenario]?"
   - "Ever felt [relatable emotion]?"
   - "Notice how [observation]?"

6. **Story Hook**
   - "Last week, I [interesting event]..."
   - "One of our customers [unexpected success]..."
   - "I used to [relatable struggle]..."

#### Hook Best Practices
- **Lead with hook**: First sentence must stop scrolling (not context or preamble)
- **Platform-specific delivery**:
  - LinkedIn: Hook in first line of text or headline
  - Twitter: Hook in first tweet of thread or first 30 chars
  - Instagram: Hook in caption or visual
  - TikTok: Hook must be visual + audio (trending sound or on-screen text)
- **Avoid clickbait**: Promise must deliver; misleading hooks destroy credibility
- **A/B test hooks**: Track which hooks drive highest engagement rate for your content type

### Carousel Design Best Practices

Carousels (multi-image posts) outperform single images on Facebook/Instagram and are effective on LinkedIn.

#### Design Principles
1. **Clear Title Slide**
   - Slide 1: Headline, benefit, or hook text (people must know what to expect)
   - Format: Bold text, high contrast, readable at small size
   - Example: "5 SEO Mistakes Killing Your Traffic" or "How We 3x'd SaaS Growth"

2. **One Concept Per Slide**
   - Don't cram 3-4 ideas on one slide; breaks scanability
   - Ideal slide progression: Intro → Insight 1 → Insight 2 → Insight 3 → Conclusion/CTA

3. **Consistent Visual Style**
   - Same background color/texture across all slides
   - Same fonts (max 2 font families)
   - Consistent color palette (3-4 colors)
   - Branded elements (logo, fonts, colors) reinforces brand

4. **Readable Text**
   - Max 3-4 lines of text per slide
   - Font size: Min 24pt (readable at 1/4 screen size)
   - High contrast (dark text on light bg or vice versa)
   - No text in bottom corners (Instagram UI covers it)

5. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - 1 headline per slide (largest text)
   - 1-2 sub-points (smaller text)
   - Supporting visual (icon, chart, image)

6. **Call-to-Action Slide**
   - Final slide: Clear CTA and next step
   - "DM for [offer]" or "Link in bio for [resource]" or "Follow for more"
   - Make it distinct from other slides (color, format)

#### Carousel Structure (5-slide template)
```
Slide 1: Hook/Title
"5 SEO Mistakes Killing Your Traffic"

Slide 2: Mistake #1
"Mistake #1: Ignoring search intent
→ Fix: Map keywords to awareness/consideration/decision stage"

Slide 3: Mistake #2
"Mistake #2: No internal linking strategy
→ Fix: Link from high-authority pages to target keywords"

Slide 4: Mistake #3
"Mistake #3: Weak landing page copy
→ Fix: Match headline to query; use social proof"

Slide 5: CTA
"Want the SEO checklist? DM me 'SEO'"
[Include brand element, visual distinctness]
```

### Thread Writing (Twitter/LinkedIn)

Threads are powerful for storytelling, education, and building audience.

#### Thread Structure
1. **Hook Tweet** (Tweet 1)
   - Bold statement, question, or curiosity gap
   - "I spent 6 months analyzing 500+ SaaS landing pages. Here's the pattern that separates $10M from $100M companies."
   - Should make people reply or retweet immediately

2. **Intro Context** (Tweet 2)
   - Briefly explain why they should care
   - "Most landing pages are missing this one thing..."
   - Build stakes (time, money, opportunity)

3. **Main Content** (Tweets 3-N)
   - Each tweet one insight, one story beat, one data point
   - Progressive disclosure: Each tweet builds on previous
   - Pattern: Setup → Insight → Evidence
   - Threads of 5-7 tweets perform better than 10+ (attention fatigue)

4. **Conclusion** (Final tweet)
   - Summarize takeaway or moral
   - CTA (follow for more, share, reply with take)
   - Create pattern: "Tweet 1 and thread X below 👇"

#### Thread Engagement Tactics
- **Pin hook tweet**: Keep Thread 1 at top of replies; people scroll first reply to see full thread
- **Quote your own thread**: Retweet hook tweet with commentary 2-3 days later (reach fresh audience)
- **Reply to own tweets**: Adds weight to thread in algorithm
- **Use polls**: Embed poll in thread to boost engagement; people must click through
- **Add data/images**: Text-only threads underperform; add image or chart every 2-3 tweets

### Video Scripts & Short-Form Content

Video content drives 1200% more shares than text + images combined.

#### Video Script Template (Reels, TikTok, YouTube Short)

**Structure**: Hook (0-3s) → Problem (3-8s) → Solution (8-20s) → CTA (20-30s)

```
[VISUAL: On-screen text or face intro]
VOICEOVER: "Everyone's telling you to do [common advice], but actually..."
[VISUAL: Cut to B-roll or data visualization]

VOICEOVER: "Here's why: [Problem statement with data or insight]"
[VISUAL: Show relatable scenario or example]

VOICEOVER: "Instead, try [Solution]. Here's how: [Step 1], [Step 2], [Step 3]"
[VISUAL: Demonstrate with clips, charts, or on-screen text]

VOICEOVER: "This shift increased our [metric] by [%]"
[VISUAL: Show result with data or screenshot]

ON-SCREEN TEXT: "[Resource link] or [CTA]"
VOICEOVER: "Let me know if you try it — reply with results"
```

#### Video Best Practices
- **First 3 seconds critical**: Hook visually and verbally
- **Captions essential**: 80% of video consumed muted; text must convey meaning
- **Trending audio**: Use platform's trending sounds (algorithmic boost)
- **B-roll & variety**: Cut frequently (every 2-3 seconds) to maintain attention
- **Call-to-action**: Clear, specific action (follow, visit link, DM, reply)
- **Length optimization**:
  - Reels: 21-34 seconds (retention sweet spot)
  - TikTok: 15-60 seconds (algorithm favors completion)
  - YouTube Shorts: 15-60 seconds
- **Retention metric**: YouTube/TikTok favor videos with 50%+ average view duration

### Hashtag Strategy

Hashtags increase discoverability but impact varies by platform.

#### Platform-Specific Hashtag Strategy
1. **LinkedIn**
   - Niche over broad: #MarketingStrategy vs. #Marketing
   - 3-5 hashtags optimal (more doesn't help; may suppress reach)
   - Algorithm values relevance; irrelevant hashtags hurt
   - Include 1 personal/brand hashtag for community

2. **Twitter**
   - 1-2 hashtags max (discovery is minimal; Twitter audience uses timeline/search bar)
   - Trending hashtags for real-time engagement (e.g., #SaaS)
   - Avoid over-tagging; looks spammy

3. **Instagram**
   - 20-30 hashtags (split: put in caption or 1st comment post-engagement to avoid spam appearance)
   - Mix strategy: 5 popular (100K+), 10 medium (10K-100K), 10 niche (1K-10K)
   - Create branded hashtag (#YourBrandInsights) for community/UGC

4. **TikTok**
   - 3-5 hashtags (include 1 trending for algorithmic boost)
   - Algorithm relies less on hashtags; focus on watch-through rate
   - Use trending sounds more than trending hashtags

#### Hashtag Research Tools & Tactics
- **Search volume**: Use platform search bar to see volume and type of content using hashtag
- **Relevance**: Only use hashtags where your content fits naturally
- **Create branded hashtag**: Build community using #YourBrand or #YourCampaign
- **Avoid**: Generic (#instagood), spam-flagged (#follow4follow), or dead hashtags

### Content Repurposing for Social

One piece of content (blog post, video, podcast) can generate 10+ social posts.

#### Repurposing Framework
1. **Blog Post → Social Pieces**
   - Main insight + CTA (as carousel intro or thread hook)
   - 3-5 supporting statistics (quoted graphic post)
   - Contrarian take or hot take (hook for thread)
   - FAQ from blog (Q&A Instagram Stories or TikTok)
   - Pull quotes from blog post (quote graphics)

2. **Video/Podcast → Social Pieces**
   - Clip best quote (15-30 sec TikTok/Reel)
   - Key statistic or insight (graphic post)
   - Guest highlight or expert take (tagged/thread)
   - Full episode link with testimonial (Story or post)

3. **Infographic → Social Pieces**
   - Full graphic (single post)
   - Individual sections (carousel slides)
   - Key insight + stat (quote graphic)
   - "Swipe" or "Save this" CTA post

#### Repurposing Timeline
- **Day 0**: Publish original content (blog, video, etc.)
- **Day 1**: Share to primary platform (LinkedIn article, YouTube video)
- **Day 2-3**: Create 3-5 derivative social posts (quotes, stats, hooks)
- **Day 5-7**: Share derivative posts across secondary platforms
- **Week 2-4**: Repost top performer with updated caption

### Building a Personal Brand on Social

Personal brands drive more engagement and trust than corporate accounts.

#### Personal Branding Pillars
1. **Expertise**: Share knowledge, insights, frameworks from your domain
2. **Personality**: Be yourself; authentic personalities attract followers
3. **Perspective**: Unique viewpoint (contrarian takes, unique synthesis of ideas)
4. **Generosity**: Share freely without gating (builds trust, authority)
5. **Community**: Engage, reply, celebrate others; don't broadcast only

#### Content Mix for Personal Brand
- **60% Value**: Educational, actionable insights, frameworks, data
- **20% Personal**: Behind-the-scenes, wins, failures, honest moments
- **15% Engagement**: Asking questions, replying to comments, community
- **5% Promotional**: Subtle CTA (link in bio, book recommendations, your product/service)

#### Personal Brand Best Practices
- **Consistent perspective**: Pick 2-3 topics you're known for; become the go-to voice
- **Authentic voice**: Use your language, humor, values (not corporate copy)
- **Show your work**: Share processes, case studies, learnings; transparency builds trust
- **Engage genuinely**: Reply thoughtfully to followers; build relationships
- **Consistency**: Post regularly (3-5 times per week) and commit for 3-6 months before assessing

### Measuring Social Performance

#### Key Metrics by Goal
1. **Awareness/Reach**
   - Impressions (how many people saw content)
   - Reach (unique people)
   - Share of voice (your content vs. competitors in topic)

2. **Engagement**
   - Engagement rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) ÷ Impressions × 100
   - Target: 1-5% for established accounts; 5%+ indicates strong content
   - Individual metrics: Likes (low-friction), Comments (thoughtful), Shares (highly valuable)

3. **Growth**
   - Followers gained per month (trend over 3+ months)
   - Follower growth rate = (New followers ÷ Total followers) × 100
   - Benchmark: 1-2% monthly growth for consistent posting

4. **Conversions**
   - Clicks to landing page (from bio link, CTAs)
   - Leads generated (email signups, contact form submissions)
   - Sales (if directly attributable)
   - Cost per lead/sale (ad spend on social vs. conversions)

5. **Audience Health**
   - Follower quality (are they engaged? Are they your target audience?)
   - Comment sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
   - Share of followers' attention (are they following competitors too?)

#### Analytics Tools & Dashboards
- **Native platforms**: LinkedIn Analytics, Twitter Analytics, Instagram Insights, TikTok Analytics
- **Third-party**: Hootsuite, Buffer, Sprout Social (cross-platform tracking)
- **Custom dashboard**: Spreadsheet or Looker dashboard tracking key metrics over time

#### Performance Benchmarking & Optimization
- **Baseline**: Track metrics for 30 days to establish baseline (engagement rate, CTR, follower growth)
- **Top performers**: Identify top 20% of content (by engagement, reach, or conversions)
- **Analyze winners**: What's different? Topic? Hook? Time posted? Format?
- **Double down**: Create more content similar to top performers
- **Remove underperformers**: Pause content receiving <0.5% engagement rate

## Process (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Social Strategy & Audience Definition
- [ ] Define primary goal: Lead generation, brand awareness, community, sales, or thought leadership
- [ ] Identify 2-3 primary platforms based on audience presence (LinkedIn for B2B, Instagram for B2C/lifestyle, Twitter for developers/tech)
- [ ] Research target audience on chosen platforms:
  - Demographics (age, job title, industry)
  - Pain points and interests
  - How they consume content (short-form video, long-form articles, real-time chat)
  - Competitors and accounts they follow
- [ ] Define content pillars (2-3 main topics you'll consistently share on)
  - Example for SaaS marketer: Product growth, content marketing, personal insights
  - Ensure pillars align with audience interests and your expertise
- [ ] Set baseline metrics (current followers, engagement rate, reach)
- [ ] Define success metrics (engagement rate target, follower growth rate, conversion rate)

### 2. Content Calendar & Planning
- [ ] Create content calendar for 4-12 weeks (Google Sheets or Asana)
  - Map content by platform, date, pillar, format
  - Plan content themes weekly or by campaign
- [ ] Identify 3-5 cornerstone pieces to develop:
  - 1-2 big article or video projects (repurposed to 10+ social posts)
  - 1-2 personal stories or case studies
  - Regular tips, insights, or educational content
- [ ] Set posting frequency:
  - LinkedIn: 2-4 posts/week
  - Twitter: 3-10 posts/day
  - Instagram: 3-5 posts/week + Daily Stories
  - TikTok: 1-3 posts/day
- [ ] Pre-create content batch (2-4 weeks of posts at once)
  - Reduces friction, improves consistency
  - Batch filming/writing saves time

### 3. Hook & Copy Writing
- [ ] For each post, write 3 hook variations (choose strongest)
  - Use hook formulas: Curiosity gap, bold statement, promise, pattern interrupt, question, story
- [ ] Write body copy aligned to platform:
  - LinkedIn: Professional, longer-form, industry insights
  - Twitter: Conversational, direct, sometimes casual
  - Instagram: Storytelling, aspirational, caption-focused
- [ ] Add CTAs:
  - Soft (reply, share, save): drives engagement
  - Medium (follow, link in bio): builds audience
  - Hard (DM, sign up, buy): conversion-focused
- [ ] Proofread and ensure brand voice consistent

### 4. Visual Design & Creative Development
- [ ] For static posts: Design or source high-quality image
  - Ensure readable, on-brand, relevant to copy
  - Optimize for platform (LinkedIn: 1200x627px, Instagram: 1080x1080px)
  - Use consistent color palette and fonts
- [ ] For carousels: Design 5-10 slides
  - Title slide (hook)
  - 3-5 content slides (one insight per slide)
  - CTA slide
  - Use Canva, Figma, or design tool with brand template
- [ ] For video: Film or source video content
  - Hook in first 3 seconds
  - Add captions/text overlay (readable without sound)
  - Optimize length per platform (21-34s for Reels, 15-60s for TikTok)
  - Use trending audio (Instagram, TikTok)
- [ ] Batch create graphics: Weekly batch of 5-10 designs saves time

### 5. Posting & Scheduling
- [ ] Use scheduling tool (Buffer, Hootsuite, or native platform scheduler)
  - Schedule posts 1-2 weeks in advance to automate publishing
  - Maintain consistency without daily manual posting
- [ ] Optimal posting times (test and adjust based on platform analytics):
  - LinkedIn: Weekday mornings (8-10am)
  - Twitter: Weekday 9am-5pm (high traffic, conversation-focused)
  - Instagram: Evenings (6-9pm) weekday or morning (8-11am) weekends
  - TikTok: Post in morning, evening, night (audience active throughout day)
- [ ] Publish for your audience's timezone (not your own)
- [ ] For live/trending content: Skip scheduler; post immediately while trending

### 6. Engagement & Community Management
- [ ] Daily: Check notifications, replies, DMs
  - Reply to every comment within 24 hours (boosts algorithm)
  - Thoughtful replies (not just "thanks!") encourage more engagement
  - Ask follow-up questions to extend conversations
- [ ] Engage with others' content:
  - Follow and engage with 10-20 relevant accounts 3x per week
  - Comment genuinely on posts in your industry (networking + reach)
  - Retweet/share others' content with added value (builds goodwill)
- [ ] Build community:
  - Ask questions to encourage replies
  - Start weekly thread or series (recurring content improves audience)
  - Celebrate follower wins or tag collaborators
- [ ] Monitor comments for sentiment (negative feedback deserves thoughtful response)

### 7. Analytics Review & Optimization (Weekly/Monthly)
- [ ] Weekly check:
  - Look at top 3 posts (by engagement, reach, or conversions)
  - Identify patterns: Topic? Hook? Format? Time?
  - Check engagement rate trend (stable, growing, or declining?)
- [ ] Monthly deep dive:
  - Calculate engagement rate, reach per post, follower growth rate
  - Identify top 20% of content; analyze what made it successful
  - Identify bottom 20%; assess if topic is wrong, hook is weak, or format isn't working
  - Plan content changes based on learnings
- [ ] Quarterly strategy assessment:
  - Are we hitting our goals (followers, engagement, conversions)?
  - Should we adjust platforms, content pillars, or posting frequency?
  - Test new formats (video, threads, series) and measure impact

### 8. Content Repurposing & Scaling
- [ ] After publishing cornerstone content (blog, video), create derivative social posts:
  - Extract 5-7 key quotes or insights
  - Pull statistics or surprising findings
  - Create carousel from sections
  - Film short "teaser" video
- [ ] Schedule derivative posts across 2-4 weeks (don't dump all at once)
- [ ] Reuse best-performing posts:
  - Repurpose top post with new angle/caption every 30-90 days
  - Test hook variations of high-performing posts
- [ ] Document repurposing template for your top content types
  - Blog post → 8 social posts (template)
  - Video → 5 social posts (template)
  - Saves time on future repurposing
