# Pricing Strategy

## Purpose
Pricing Strategy involves developing and optimizing pricing models to maximize revenue while maintaining customer value perception. This skill helps you understand how to price products competitively, communicate value, and use pricing as a strategic tool to drive growth.

## When to Use
- Launching a new product and determining initial pricing
- Pricing a new service or offering
- Considering a price increase (internal communication, market research)
- Struggling with revenue growth despite user growth
- Optimizing pricing to improve margins or LTV
- Planning tiered/freemium pricing structures
- Competing in markets with established pricing norms
- Preparing to launch into new markets with different pricing power

## Core Frameworks & Knowledge

### Pricing Models

**Value-Based Pricing**
- **Definition**: Price based on perceived value to customer, not cost
- **When to use**: When you have unique/differentiated product, strong brand, proven ROI
- **How to determine**: Understand what customers would pay based on value delivered
- **Advantages**: Higher margins, aligns with value delivery, more profitable
- **Disadvantages**: Requires understanding customer willingness to pay
- **Example**: SaaS that saves customers $100K/year can price at $10-50K/year
- **Process**: Quantify customer benefits (time saved × hourly rate, revenue gained, costs avoided)

**Cost-Plus Pricing**
- **Definition**: Set price at cost + desired margin (e.g., cost × 2)
- **When to use**: Commodity products, B2B services, cost-driven businesses
- **Advantages**: Simple, ensures profit, predictable
- **Disadvantages**: Ignores market demand, leaves money on table, doesn't account for value
- **Example**: Consultant charges $150/hour (cost) + 50% markup = $225/hour
- **Risk**: Customer only cares about their perceived value, not your costs

**Competitor-Based Pricing**
- **Definition**: Price based on what competitors charge
- **When to use**: Entering established market, undifferentiated products, commodities
- **Advantages**: Market-validated, defensible, reduces risk
- **Disadvantages**: Can lead to race to bottom, ignores your differentiation
- **Example**: New credit card with 1.5% APR competitors charge 1.8%
- **Use case**: Price slightly below (undercutting) or slightly above (quality signal) competitors

**Tiered/Good-Better-Best Pricing**
- **Definition**: Multiple pricing tiers offering different value levels
- **Benefits**: Captures different customer segments, increases revenue, simplifies choice
- **Structure**:
  - **Good**: Entry tier, basic features, lowest price (gets price-conscious customers in)
  - **Better**: Mid tier, more features, sweet spot for value (most conversions happen here)
  - **Best**: Premium tier, all features, highest price (for power users and enterprises)
- **Pricing rule**: Usually Good = $X, Better = $X × 2-3, Best = $X × 5-10
- **Feature distribution**: Each tier should feel like distinct value jump (not just feature count)
- **Example**:
  - Basic: $29/month (1 user, 5 projects)
  - Professional: $79/month (5 users, unlimited projects)
  - Enterprise: Custom pricing (unlimited everything + support)

**Freemium Model**
- **Definition**: Free tier attracts users, paid tier generates revenue
- **When it works**: Network effects, viral potential, high conversion rate to paid
- **When it fails**: Low conversion to paid, high support costs, unclear paid value prop
- **Conversion rates**: 2-5% is typical, industry varies widely
- **Key decisions**:
  - What's free? (Limited users, features, data)
  - What's paid? (Unlimited access, advanced features)
  - Free trial vs. free tier? (Trial has end date, free tier is permanent)
- **Example**: Slack (free forever tier with limitations) vs. Figma (free trial)
- **Danger**: Free tier attracts wrong customers who never pay

**Usage-Based Pricing**
- **Definition**: Customers pay for what they use (price × consumption)
- **When to use**: Infrastructure/API products, consumption varies widely, variable costs
- **Advantages**: Aligns pricing with value, scales with customer success, low friction entry
- **Disadvantages**: Unpredictable revenue, requires metering/tracking, seat scaling is unclear
- **Example**: AWS ($0.10 per GB), Stripe ($0.029 + 2.9% per transaction)
- **Hybrid approach**: Base fee + usage (covers predictable costs + scales with usage)

**Hybrid Models**
- **Freemium + Upsell**: Free tier attracts users, paid tiers increase features
- **Subscription + Usage**: Base monthly fee + overage charges
- **Flat + Performance**: Base tier + performance tier at higher price
- **Commitment discount**: Pay upfront annually and save 15-25% vs. monthly

### Annual vs. Monthly Pricing
- **Monthly**: Easier to try, lower commitment, higher churn, lower lifetime value
- **Annual**: Higher commitment, lower churn, better predictability, higher lifetime value
- **Best practice**: Offer both, incentivize annual (give 15-25% discount for annual)
- **Discount strategy**: Annual = Monthly × 10 × 0.85 (roughly 15% savings)
- **Example**: $10/month = $120/year OR $102/year for annual (15% discount)

### Pricing Psychology & Tactics
- **Charm pricing**: $99 feels cheaper than $100 (works, use it)
- **Price anchoring**: Show higher price first ($999 → now $299)
- **Odd pricing**: $9.99 vs. $10 (odd numbers appear cheaper even if 1¢ difference)
- **Even pricing**: $20 for premium/quality products (signals higher quality)
- **Prestige pricing**: Luxury products use higher prices to signal quality
- **Bundle pricing**: Multiple items together = perceived value increase
- **Decoy pricing**: Add expensive option to make middle option look better
- **FOMO pricing**: Early-bird discount, limited-time offer, grandfather pricing

### Pricing Page Design
- **Clarity**: Clear tier names, clear features, clear pricing
- **Highlight recommended**: Most popular tier gets visual prominence
- **Feature comparison**: Show what's included in each tier
- **CTAs**: Clear call-to-action button for each tier
- **Social proof**: Show number of customers, testimonials, reviews
- **FAQ section**: Answer pricing questions, explain value, address concerns
- **Risk reversal**: Money-back guarantee, free trial, easy cancel
- **Mobile responsive**: Ensure pricing page works on mobile

### Pricing Communication
- **When increasing price**:
  1. Grandfather existing customers (lock in old price)
  2. Announce ahead of time (30-90 days notice)
  3. Explain value justification (what's new, better, different)
  4. Frame positively (not "raising price" but "adding value")
  5. Offer early-bird at lower new price for window
  6. Consider retention: if raising >20%, prepare for churn
- **Example communication**: "Starting January 1st, new customers will pay $99/month. If you're an existing customer, you'll keep your current price of $79/month. We're raising prices because [benefits added]."

### Discounting Strategy
- **Overuse risk**: Discounting trains customers to wait for deals
- **Strategic discounting**: Use discounts to remove barriers, not habitual
- **Discount types**:
  - Annual discount (15-25% off)
  - Early-bird discount (for new products)
  - Volume discount (for larger commitment)
  - Seasonal discount (limited time, not habitual)
  - Partnership discount (for joint customers)
- **Alternatives to discounting**:
  - Trial period (reduce commitment risk)
  - Payment plans (spread cost)
  - Money-back guarantee (reduce risk)
  - Free consultation (add value without discount)

### Market Segmentation & Pricing
- **Segment by company size**: Startup ($29), SMB ($99), Enterprise (custom)
- **Segment by use case**: Basic ($29), Pro ($79), Agency ($199)
- **Segment by geography**: Adjust pricing for purchasing power by region
- **Segment by commitment**: Monthly higher price, annual lower price
- **Willingness to pay**: Power users can pay more, price accordingly

## Process (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis (2-3 weeks)
1. **Understand costs**: What are your unit economics? What margin do you need?
2. **Competitor analysis**: What do competitors charge? How do they structure pricing?
3. **Customer research**: What would customers pay? What's their willingness to pay?
4. **Value analysis**: What quantifiable value does product deliver to customers?
   - Time saved (hours × hourly cost)
   - Revenue generated (if product is revenue-generating)
   - Costs avoided or reduced
5. **Market research**: Industry pricing norms, benchmarks, trends
6. **Customer segmentation**: Are there different customer types with different willingness to pay?
7. **Document findings**: Summarize research in pricing research document

### Phase 2: Determine Pricing Model (1-2 weeks)
1. **Evaluate options**: Which model fits your product best?
   - Value-based? (if strong ROI/value)
   - Cost-plus? (if cost-driven)
   - Competitor-based? (if undifferentiated)
   - Usage-based? (if consumption varies)
   - Tiered? (if multiple customer segments)
   - Freemium? (if you want viral growth)
2. **Model out economics**: How many customers × average price = revenue?
3. **Stress test**: What if conversion is 50% lower? 50% higher?
4. **Validate assumptions**: Are margins healthy? Is pricing competitive?
5. **Make recommendation**: Document selected model with rationale

### Phase 3: Set Pricing & Tiers (1-2 weeks)
1. **Determine price points**: Using research + economics, set specific prices
2. **Create tier structure**: If tiered, define features for each tier
   - What's in Good tier? Better tier? Best tier?
   - Ensure clear feature jumps (not just count)
   - Price ratio usually Good:Better:Best = 1:2.5:5
3. **Test psychology**: Apply charm pricing, anchoring, etc.
4. **Validate with customers**: Survey 10-20 customers (would you buy at $X?)
5. **Make final adjustments**: Based on feedback and economics
6. **Document**: Pricing model, tiers, features, rationale

### Phase 4: Develop Pricing Page (1-2 weeks)
1. **Design pricing page**: Clear layout showing tiers, features, pricing
2. **Write copy**: Explain value, justify pricing, communicate tiers
3. **Feature matrix**: Show what's included/excluded in each tier
4. **CTAs**: Create clear call-to-action buttons
5. **Social proof**: Add testimonials, customer count, reviews
6. **FAQ**: Answer common pricing questions
7. **Design elements**: Risk reversal (guarantee, trial, cancel anytime)
8. **Mobile optimize**: Ensure pricing page works on all devices

### Phase 5: Test Pricing (2-4 weeks)
1. **A/B test prices**: Test $99 vs $99 vs $89 (control vs options)
2. **A/B test tiers**: Test Good-Better-Best vs Good-Best vs 4-tier
3. **A/B test messaging**: Test annual discount incentive copy
4. **A/B test page design**: Test which tier highlighted as recommended
5. **Measure**: Track conversion rate, average deal size, customer lifetime value
6. **Iterate**: Make changes based on results
7. **Continue testing**: Optimize pricing incrementally over time

### Phase 6: Launch & Monitor (Ongoing)
1. **Communication**: Announce new pricing (email, blog, sales team)
2. **Transition plan**: If existing customers, grandfather old prices
3. **Sales enablement**: Brief sales team on tiers, positioning, objection handling
4. **Monitor metrics**: Track conversion rate, deal size, churn, NPS
5. **Gather feedback**: Survey customers on pricing perception
6. **Adjust if needed**: If conversion drops significantly, revisit
7. **Plan next review**: Schedule quarterly pricing review

### Phase 7: Continuous Optimization (Ongoing)
1. **Monitor competition**: What are competitors doing?
2. **Track economics**: Is pricing aligned with unit economics?
3. **Analyze cohorts**: Do different customer segments have different churn?
4. **Plan price increases**: When should we raise prices?
5. **Test discounting**: Should we discount? When? How much?
6. **Gather customer feedback**: What do customers think about pricing?
7. **Iterate**: Make small changes regularly, not big quarterly changes
