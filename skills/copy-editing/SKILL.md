# Copy Editing

## Purpose
Edit and improve existing marketing copy to increase clarity, impact, and conversions. Copy editing takes good marketing copy and makes it great by cutting clutter, strengthening language, and aligning tone with brand voice. Well-edited copy increases conversion rates by 10-30% without changing core message.

## When to Use
- You have existing marketing copy that feels wordy or unclear
- You want to improve headline effectiveness and impact
- You need to reduce word count (cut from 500 words to 250)
- You want to strengthen call-to-action language
- You need to align copy across pages to consistent brand voice
- You want to simplify jargon for a broader audience
- You're A/B testing different copy variations
- You want to improve readability (Flesch-Kincaid score)
- You want to remove weak words and replace with power words
- You need to improve email subject lines or headlines

## Core Frameworks & Knowledge

### Copy Editing Hierarchy (Most to Least Important)
1. **Clarity**: Reader understands your message (use short sentences)
2. **Concision**: No unnecessary words (cut 20-40% of words)
3. **Tone alignment**: Matches brand voice (professional vs casual)
4. **Persuasion**: Convinces reader to act (stronger language, power words)
5. **Style**: Grammar, punctuation, consistency (least important)

### Readability Metrics
- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: Target 8-10 (high school student understands)
  - High grade level (12+) = harder to read, loses readers
  - Short sentences = lower grade level = easier reading
  - Example: "Utilize the dashboard to optimize efficiency" = Grade 12
  - Better: "Use the dashboard to work faster" = Grade 8
- **Word count**: Shorter is better. Cut 30-40% of words without losing meaning
- **Sentence length**: Target 10-15 words average (range 5-20)
- **Paragraph length**: 2-4 sentences max for digital (short = scannable)
- **Active voice**: "We created this tool" > "This tool was created"

### Power Words & Weak Words
- **Weak**: very, really, quite, somewhat, almost, just, fairly, rather, arguably
- **Weak**: utilize, implement, facilitate, leverage (corporate jargon)
- **Weak**: provide, offer (passive-sounding)
- **Power words** (benefit-focused): Save, earn, discover, unlock, transform, proven, guaranteed, instant, exclusive
- **Power words** (urgency): Today, now, immediately, limited, deadline, soon
- **Power words** (emotional): Effortless, peace of mind, proven, trusted, award-winning

### Common Copy Problems
- **Too long**: Every paragraph is 5+ sentences
- **Passive voice**: "The report was generated" instead of "You generated the report"
- **Jargon**: "Leverage our solution ecosystem" (unclear)
- **Weak verbs**: "Very good results" instead of "Exceptional results"
- **Redundancy**: "Important and critical" (saying same thing twice)
- **Vague pronouns**: "It improves your workflow" (what is "it"?)
- **Overcomplicated**: 25-word sentence when 15 words works

## Process

### Step 1: Read Copy Aloud & Identify Issues

1. **Read entire piece aloud** (slowly, pausing at punctuation):
   - Where do you stumble? (Complex sentence)
   - Where do you need to breathe? (Too many long sentences)
   - What phrases sound awkward? (Unnatural phrasing)
   - What's unclear? (Confusing message)

2. **Identify specific problems**:
   - Sentence: "The implementation of our solution drives operational excellence through synergistic paradigms"
     - Problem: Jargon, passive, unclear
     - Rewrite: "Our solution helps your team work faster"

   - Sentence: "It is important to note that very significant improvements in productivity can be achieved"
     - Problem: Weak words (it is, very, important to note), passive voice
     - Rewrite: "You'll save hours every week"

3. **List top 3-5 issues**:
   - Too wordy (cut 40% of words)
   - Unclear jargon (what does "synergize" mean?)
   - Weak headline (doesn't convey benefit)
   - Passive voice throughout
   - Inconsistent tone (shifts from casual to formal)

### Step 2: Headline Optimization

**Headlines are most important element. 80% of readers read only the headline.**

1. **Headline audit**:
   ```
   Current: "Solution for Business Process Optimization"
   Problems: Generic, vague, jargon, no benefit

   Rewritten: "Save 10 Hours Every Week"
   Improvement: Specific benefit, quantified, action-focused
   ```

2. **Headline formulas** (proven patterns):
   - **Benefit-driven**: "[Benefit]. [How to get it]"
     - "Save 5 hours/week. Here's how." (curiosity + benefit)

   - **Curiosity hook**: "[Surprising claim] that [benefit]"
     - "The productivity hack 100,000+ teams use"

   - **Question format**: "Want to [benefit]? [How]"
     - "Want to ship 3x faster? Try our GitHub integration."

   - **Urgency**: "[Benefit], [time frame]"
     - "Get started in 5 minutes"

   - **Contrast**: "[Before] vs [After]"
     - "Stop wasting time on admin work"

   - **Number-driven**: "[Number] ways to [benefit]"
     - "5 ways to reduce customer churn"

   - **Guarantee**: "Guaranteed [benefit] or [consequence]"
     - "Guaranteed to save you 1 hour/day or your money back"

3. **Test headline variations**:
   - Original: "Increase Team Productivity"
   - Variation 1: "Save 5 Hours Every Week" (specific benefit)
   - Variation 2: "The productivity tool your team actually enjoys" (emotional benefit)
   - Variation 3: "Reduce admin work by 50%" (quantified benefit)
   - A/B test variations; measure click-through rate or conversion

4. **Headline length**:
   - Target: 6-10 words (short, snappy, readable)
   - Max: 12 words (if necessary for clarity)
   - Avoid: 15+ words (loses impact, hard to scan)

### Step 3: Cut Word Count by 30-40%

**Most copy can be cut in half without losing meaning. Be ruthless.**

1. **Identify redundant phrases**:
   ```
   "critical and important" → "critical" (pick one)
   "a very unique solution" → "unique" (unique already means one-of-a-kind)
   "absolutely essential" → "essential"
   "fast-paced and rapid growth" → "rapid growth"
   ```

2. **Remove filler words** (add nothing):
   - "Very" (he's very smart → he's brilliant)
   - "Really" (it's really good → it's excellent)
   - "Just" (it's just a simple tool → it's a simple tool)
   - "Actually" (it actually works → it works)
   - "Sort of" (it sort of solves the problem → it solves the problem)

3. **Cut qualifiers and hedges**:
   - "Rather" / "somewhat" / "fairly" / "quite" / "arguably"
   - These weaken your message. Remove them.
   - Bad: "Somewhat improves your workflow"
   - Good: "Improves your workflow"

4. **Remove obvious statements**:
   ```
   "Our software is designed to help users achieve their goals"
   Problem: Generic, obvious, vague
   Cut: Remove entirely or rewrite with specific benefit
   Rewrite: "Save 2 hours/day on admin tasks"
   ```

5. **Cut introductory phrases**:
   - "It is important to note that..." → Delete "It is important to note that"
   - "In order to..." → "To"
   - "As it turns out..." → Delete
   - "Due to the fact that..." → "Because"

6. **Example of 40% cut**:
   ```
   Original (134 words):
   "Our innovative platform is designed to help small business owners
   improve their operational efficiency and streamline their workflow
   processes in order to save them valuable time that can be reinvested
   into growing their business. Through the use of our proprietary
   technology, users are able to automate repetitive tasks and eliminate
   manual work that distracts from core business activities. By
   implementing our solution, companies have reported improvements in
   productivity and have been able to reduce costs associated with
   administrative overhead."

   Edited (78 words):
   "Save 10 hours/week on admin work. Our platform automates repetitive
   tasks so your team can focus on growing your business. Companies
   using our solution report 25% improvement in productivity and 15%
   cost reduction. Start free today—no credit card required."

   Reduction: 42% (56 fewer words)
   Improvement: Clearer, more benefit-focused, specific metrics
   ```

### Step 4: Strengthen Voice & Tone

**Copy should match brand personality consistently.**

1. **Identify current tone**:
   - Professional (formal, corporate)
   - Friendly (approachable, conversational)
   - Playful (witty, humorous)
   - Bold (confident, assertive)
   - Educational (informative, helpful)
   - Urgent (time-sensitive, action-focused)

2. **Ensure consistency**:
   - Page 1: Friendly tone ("Hey, let's make your life easier")
   - Page 2: Formal tone ("Facilitate operational excellence")
   - Problem: Tonal inconsistency = confusing brand
   - Solution: Choose one voice; apply across all pages

3. **Tone shifting** (by context):
   ```
   Homepage (friendly): "Save hours every week with our tool"
   Enterprise page (professional): "Streamline operations for teams of any size"
   Sales email (urgent): "Limited spots for founding member pricing. Lock in yours."

   All consistent with brand = better perception
   ```

4. **Second person ("you") vs first person ("we")**:
   - **"You" statements** (benefit-focused): "You'll save hours" (reader-centric, strong)
   - **"We" statements** (company-focused): "We help you save hours" (weaker, less direct)
   - Best practice: Start with "you" benefit, then "we" support it
   - Example: "Save 10 hours/week. We make it effortless."

5. **Common tone problems**:
   - **Too corporate**: "Leverage our synergistic solutions" → "Use our tool"
   - **Too casual for B2B**: "Yo, your team's gonna love this" → "Your team will love this"
   - **Inconsistent**: Mix of formal and casual → Pick one
   - **Self-focused**: "We're proud of our platform" → "You'll ship 3x faster"

### Step 5: Replace Weak Words with Power Words

**Word choice dramatically impacts persuasiveness.**

1. **Weak verb replacement**:
   ```
   "Provide" → "Give", "Deliver", "Enable"
   "Utilize" → "Use"
   "Implement" → "Start", "Build", "Create"
   "Facilitate" → "Enable", "Make"
   "Leverage" → "Use", "Take advantage of"
   "Manage" → "Control", "Master"
   "Very good" → "Exceptional", "Outstanding", "Excellent"
   "Help" → "Enable", "Empower", "Transform" (context-dependent)
   ```

2. **Benefit-focused power words**:
   - Save (time, money, effort)
   - Gain (insights, control, confidence)
   - Unlock (potential, features, growth)
   - Transform (business, workflow, results)
   - Master (skill, process, tool)
   - Eliminate (waste, friction, problems)
   - Accelerate (growth, shipping, decisions)
   - Maximize (revenue, efficiency, impact)

3. **Urgency & scarcity power words**:
   - Now, today, immediately
   - Limited, exclusive, rare
   - Only [X] left, deadline approaching
   - Founders pricing, founding member
   - Don't miss out, act now

4. **Trust & proof power words**:
   - Proven (backed by data)
   - Trusted (by 50,000+ teams)
   - Award-winning (recognized authority)
   - Guaranteed (promises certainty)
   - Verified (third-party confirmed)

5. **Example word replacements**:
   ```
   Weak: "Very fast implementation and excellent results"
   Strong: "Deploy in 1 day. 30% revenue increase."

   Weak: "Our platform helps facilitate better team communication"
   Strong: "Unify your team. Eliminate scattered conversations."

   Weak: "Many customers have seen positive outcomes"
   Strong: "10,000+ teams ship 3x faster"
   ```

### Step 6: Fix Jargon & Clarity Issues

**Jargon confuses readers. Use plain language.**

1. **Identify jargon** (buzzwords that confuse):
   ```
   "Synergistic ecosystem" → What does this mean? Cut or replace.
   "Paradigm shift" → Vague; replace with specific benefit
   "Digital transformation" → Vague; be specific ("automate your workflow")
   "Omnichannel experience" → Plain language: "Works everywhere"
   "Best-of-breed solution" → Replace with specific benefit
   "Enterprise-grade" → Plain language: "Reliable, secure, proven"
   ```

2. **Clarify vague pronouns**:
   ```
   Bad: "Our solution helps with this by using advanced algorithms"
   Problem: "This" and "it" are vague
   Good: "Our tool identifies bottlenecks in your workflow using AI"
   ```

3. **Break down complex sentences**:
   ```
   Complex: "Through the implementation of advanced algorithmic analysis,
   users can leverage predictive insights to optimize their operational
   efficiency and achieve measurable improvements in key performance
   indicators."

   Simple: "Get predictive insights. Make smarter decisions. See
   measurable results."

   Improvement: 3 short, clear sentences > 1 complex sentence
   ```

4. **Define specialized terms**:
   - If you must use jargon, explain it briefly
   - "API (a way for tools to talk to each other)"
   - "Webhook (automatic notifications when something happens)"

### Step 7: Optimize CTA (Call-to-Action)

**CTA language dramatically impacts click-through rate.**

1. **CTA best practices**:
   - **Action-oriented**: "Get started" > "Click here"
   - **Specific**: "Get the checklist" > "Download"
   - **Benefit-driven**: "Save 5 hours" > "Learn more"
   - **Clear outcome**: User knows what happens if they click
   - **Button color**: Contrasting color (not primary brand color)

2. **CTA variations** (test these):
   ```
   Generic: "Submit" (5% click rate)
   Better: "Get started free" (10% click rate)
   Best: "Start saving hours" (15% click rate)

   Generic: "Learn more"
   Better: "See the demo"
   Best: "See how 10k+ teams save time"
   ```

3. **CTA for different contexts**:
   - Homepage: "Start free" / "Get started"
   - Feature page: "Try it free"
   - Pricing page: "Start trial" / "Upgrade"
   - Case study: "Read the story"
   - Email: "Grab yours" / "Lock it in"

4. **Button text psychology**:
   - **"Free"**: Removes price barrier (high click rate)
   - **"Today"**: Urgency (higher conversion)
   - **"Now"**: Immediacy (higher conversion)
   - **"Limited"**: Scarcity (higher conversion)
   - **Verb**: "Start", "Get", "Unlock" (stronger than "Go to")

### Step 8: Readability Scoring & Assessment

**Measure readability to ensure copy is accessible.**

1. **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**:
   - Formula: ((0.39 × words/sentences) + (11.8 × syllables/words) - 15.59)
   - Target: 8-10 (high school reading level)
   - Grade 7: 8th-grade student understands easily
   - Grade 12: College reading level; loses casual readers
   - Grade 14+: Expert level; very hard to read

   Tools: Grammarly, Hemingway Editor, readability-score.com

2. **How to improve readability**:
   - Reduce average sentence length (shorter = easier)
   - Use shorter words (3+ syllables = harder to read)
   - Use active voice (more direct, easier to follow)
   - Break paragraphs into smaller chunks (whitespace = scannable)
   - Use lists and bullet points

3. **Before/after readability**:
   ```
   Before (Grade 14):
   "The implementation of sophisticated technological infrastructure
   facilitates the optimization of multifaceted operational processes."

   After (Grade 8):
   "Our tool makes your work faster and easier."

   Improvement: Grade 14 → Grade 8 (much more accessible)
   ```

### Step 9: Copy Editing Checklist

**Use this checklist for every piece of copy you edit.**

1. **Clarity** (most important):
   - [ ] Is headline clear benefit-focused?
   - [ ] Does every sentence serve a purpose?

   - [ ] Are typos eliminated?
   - [ ] Is formatting consistent?

### Step 10: Before/After Examples

**Real examples of copy editing improvements:**

1. **Example 1: Homepage Hero Copy**
   ```
   BEFORE (108 words, Grade 13):
   "Our innovative platform is designed to empower businesses of all
   sizes to optimize their operational workflows and achieve significant
   improvements in efficiency and productivity. Through the implementation
   of our advanced technology solutions, companies are able to streamline
   processes, reduce administrative overhead, and focus resources on
   strategic growth initiatives. With a comprehensive suite of tools
   and features, our platform provides the necessary infrastructure
   to facilitate digital transformation."

   AFTER (38 words, Grade 7):
   "Save 10 hours/week. Our platform automates busywork so you can
   focus on growing your business. Join 50,000+ teams."

   Improvement: 65% word reduction, Grade 13→7, clearer benefit
   ```

2. **Example 2: Feature Description**
   ```
   BEFORE:
   "Our solution facilitates the optimization of team collaboration
   through the implementation of real-time synchronization and
   asynchronous communication paradigms."

   AFTER:
   "Your team stays in sync. Comment, share, and collaborate in
   real-time—or asynchronously when needed."

   Improvement: Clearer, shorter, benefit-focused
   ```

3. **Example 3: Email Subject Lines**
   ```
   BEFORE: "Important Product Update"
   Problem: Generic, no curiosity

   VARIATION 1: "See your team's productivity gains in 48 hours"
   Better: Specific benefit

   VARIATION 2: "Your 10-hour/week saving is ready"
   Best: Personalized benefit, curiosity

   Recommendation: Test variations 1 & 2; measure open rate
   ```

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity first**: Confused readers don't convert. Make it obvious.
2. **Cut ruthlessly**: Remove 30-40% of words. Most copy is bloated.
3. **Benefit-focused**: Users don't care about features; they care about outcomes.
4. **Active voice**: "You'll save 10 hours" > "Efficiency will be improved"
5. **Short sentences**: 10-15 words average; ranges from 5-20
6. **Power words**: Choose strong verbs and benefit words
7. **Consistent tone**: Pick one voice; stick with it
8. **Scannable**: Use lists, short paragraphs, whitespace
9. **Test variations**: A/B test headlines and CTAs
10. **Measure results**: Track conversion impact of copy changes
