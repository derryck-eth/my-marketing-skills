- Launching growth initiatives or acquisition campaigns
- Developing community engagement strategies
- Looking for partnership or collaboration opportunities
- Wanting to differentiate from competitors in crowded markets

## Core Frameworks & Knowledge

### SCAMPER Ideation Framework
SCAMPER is a technique to generate ideas by modifying existing products/campaigns:
- **Substitute**: What could we replace? (Replace X with Y)
  - Example: Email marketing → SMS; Blog posts → Video; Traditional ads → Social
- **Combine**: What could we merge? (Combine X + Y)
  - Example: Product + Customer story = Case study; Webinar + Product = Tutorial
- **Adapt**: What else is similar? (Adapt ideas from other industries)
  - Example: Netflix recommendation → Content recommendations; Subscription billing → SaaS model
- **Modify**: What could we exaggerate or change? (Make bigger, smaller, different)
  - Example: Normal event → Mini-conference; Standard demo → Extreme use-case demo
- **Put to another use**: What new purposes could it serve?
  - Example: Support documentation → Beginner tutorial series; Customer data → Research report
- **Eliminate**: What could we remove? (Simplify)
  - Example: Remove friction from signup; Remove jargon from messaging
- **Reverse**: What could we do backwards? (Invert the process)
  - Example: Instead of selling to prospects, get them to pitch to you; Instead of content download, require creation

### Constraint-Based Ideation
Often the best ideas come from constraints:
- **Budget constraint**: What can we do with $0, $100, $1,000?
- **Time constraint**: What can we execute in 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour?
- **People constraint**: What can 1 person do? What with just 3 people?
- **Channel constraint**: What if we only used Twitter? Only email? Only in-person?
- **Audience constraint**: What if we focused only on our power users? Only the underserved segment?
- **Resource constraint**: What if we only had our own content/expertise?

### Channel-Specific Marketing Ideas

**Email Marketing**
- Segment-specific campaigns (power users, at-risk, new)
- Behavioral triggers (signed up but didn't upgrade, viewed feature but didn't activate)
- Email series (onboarding, nurture, win-back)
- Personal stories from founders/team
- User wins and success stories
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Industry research or data sharing
- Exclusive offers for email subscribers

**Social Media**
- Twitter threads breaking down expertise
- LinkedIn articles on industry trends
- TikTok behind-the-scenes/day-in-the-life content
- Instagram carousel posts of data/frameworks
- Community AMAs (Ask Me Anything)
- User-generated content campaigns
- Polls and interactive content
- Trending topic hijacking (responsibly)

**Content Marketing**
- Ultimate guides (most comprehensive piece on topic)
- Comparison content (vs competitors or solutions)
- Data-driven research reports
- Interview series with industry experts
- Playbooks and frameworks
- Opposite-perspective pieces (contrarian takes)
- "X years later" retrospectives
- "We built X in public" documentation

**Community-Led Growth**
- Discord/Slack community with exclusive content
- Weekly office hours or AMA sessions
- User meetups and events
- Customer advisory board
- Community moderator program
- User-generated content campaigns
- Community challenges or competitions
- Early access for most engaged community members

**Partnership & Co-Marketing**
- Partner webinars
- Cross-promotions with complementary tools
- Co-authored content with other experts
- Referral programs (referrer and referred benefit)
- Channel partnerships
- Integration cross-promotion
- Joint events or sponsorships
- White-label opportunities

### Viral Mechanics & Growth Loops
- **Network effects**: Tool becomes more valuable as more people use it
- **Referral loops**: Built-in incentive to refer others (PayPal: $10 referral bonus)
- **Gamification**: Leaderboards, badges, achievements drive engagement and sharing
- **Social features**: Let users create, share, compete
- **Word-of-mouth**:Make product so good people naturally want to share
- **Embedded calls-to-action**: Share button in product (Figma "share this file")
- **User-generated content**: Product creates content users want to share
- **Organic viral**: Curiosity gap ("I don't understand this without knowing the context")

### Guerrilla Marketing Tactics
- **Attention hijacking**: Unexpected places your message appears (stickers, wheat paste, projection)
- **Ambient marketing**: Integrate product into everyday environment
- **Ambush marketing**: Show up where competitors are (adjacent to their booth)
- **Product stunts**: Do something newsworthy that generates media coverage
- **Street teams**: Hand out samples, create physical experiences
- **Pop-ups**: Temporary installations in high-traffic areas
- **Sampling**: Free trial or sample to get people hooked
- **Experiential**: Create memorable brand experiences

### Seasonal & Event-Based Marketing
- **New Year**: Resolutions, habit formation, fresh starts
- **Spring**: Renewal, growth, fresh beginnings
- **Summer**: Travel, outdoor, experiences
- **Back to school**: Education, productivity, organization
- **Q4/Holiday**: Gift-giving, year-end, reflection, deals
- **Industry conferences**: Sponsor, exhibit, create content around
- **Awareness months**: Tie into relevant awareness months
- **Trending moments**: React to cultural moments and trends

### User-Generated Content Campaigns
- **Hashtag campaigns**: Create branded hashtag, encourage users to post with it
- **Photo contests**: Best use of product, before/after, creative shots
- **Testimonial campaigns**: Encourage customers to share their story/results
- **Reuse strategy**: Repurpose customer content as social proof, case studies, ads
- **User spotlights**: Feature community members, their workflows, their wins
- **Challenge campaigns**: Do X with our product, share results
- **Community creations**: Customers building with your APIs or data
- **Reviews and ratings**: Encourage honest reviews on all platforms

## Process (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Brief & Context (30-60 minutes)
1. **Define the challenge**: What are we trying to achieve? (awareness, acquisition, engagement, retention, revenue)
2. **Identify success metrics**: How will we measure success?
3. **Understand constraints**: Budget, timeline, team, channels available
4. **Document existing efforts**: What have we tried? What worked? What didn't?
5. **Competitor analysis**: What are competitors doing? Where are gaps?
6. **Audience research**: Who are we targeting? What are their pain points/interests?
7. **Resource inventory**: What assets, expertise, or relationships can we leverage?

### Phase 2: Individual Ideation (30 minutes)
- Use SCAMPER framework individually
- Spend 5 minutes per letter, brainstorm wildly (no judgment)
- Write down all ideas, no filtering
- Focus on quantity over quality
- Get unconventional—the weird ideas often spark the best concepts

### Phase 3: Group Brainstorm (60 minutes)
1. **Silent brainstorm** (10 min): Everyone writes down ideas independently
2. **Share ideas** (20 min): Go around the table, share one idea at a time
3. **Build on ideas** (20 min): Use "yes, and" thinking—build on others' ideas
4. **Vote/prioritize** (10 min): Dot vote on most promising ideas
5. **Discuss top ideas** (15-20 min): Debate merits, feasibility, potential impact

### Phase 4: Concept Development (60-120 minutes)
For each top-3 idea:
1. **Define the idea clearly**: What is it exactly?
2. **Why it works**: What psychological principle/insight makes this compelling?
3. **Target audience**: Who will this resonate with most?
4. **Key message**: What's the core benefit or insight?
5. **Creative execution**: How will we bring this to life?
6. **Channels**: Where will this live? How will people find it?
7. **Timeline**: When will we execute? How long to produce?
8. **Resources needed**: Budget, team, tools, partnerships?
9. **Potential risks**: What could go wrong? How do we mitigate?
10. **Success metrics**: How do we measure success?

### Phase 5: Refinement & Validation (varies)
1. **Gut check**: Does this feel right for our brand? Will our audience respond?
2. **Customer input**: Test idea with customers or audience sample
3. **Competitive differentiation**: Does this truly stand out?
4. **Feasibility assessment**: Can we actually execute this?
5. **ROI estimation**: Does potential payoff justify the effort?
6. **Contingency planning**: What if X goes wrong?

### Phase 6: Execution Planning
1. **Create detailed brief**: Provide creative team with clear direction
2. **Assign owners**: Who is responsible for execution?
3. **Set milestones**: When should each phase be complete?
4. **Create timeline**: Start date through launch date
5. **Budget allocation**: How much to spend?
6. **Success criteria**: What's the definition of success?
7. **Monitoring plan**: How will we track performance?
