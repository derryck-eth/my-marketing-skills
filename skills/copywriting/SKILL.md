# Copywriting

## Purpose

This skill enables you to craft persuasive, benefit-driven marketing copy that converts readers into customers. Whether writing headlines, sales pages, ad copy, or email, this framework helps you align copy with prospect psychology, reduce decision friction, and lead with value. Expert copywriters use proven frameworks and structural patterns to make copy predictable, testable, and effective.

## When to Use

- **Headlines & Subject Lines**: Create attention-grabbing openings for ads, emails, landing pages, or social media
- **Sales Pages & Landing Pages**: Write full conversion-focused pages that address pain points and showcase benefits
- **Ad Copy**: Craft compelling PPC ads, social ads, and ad variations for A/B testing
- **Email Campaigns**: Write promotional, nurture, or announcement emails that move readers toward action
- **Product Descriptions**: Present features as customer benefits with specific outcomes
- **CTAs & Button Copy**: Optimize calls-to-action with outcome-focused, low-friction language
- **Before-After Scenarios**: Show transformation to make results tangible and desirable
- **Objection Handling**: Address common buyer hesitations directly in copy

## Core Frameworks

### PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
- **Problem**: Identify the specific pain point your prospect faces
- **Agitate**: Expand on the emotional cost—why this matters, what it costs them daily
- **Solution**: Introduce your product/service as the remedy; frame it as the bridge from pain to relief
- *Best for*: Sales pages, email sequences, long-form ads, testimonials

### AIDA Framework (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
- **Attention**: Hook with a surprising stat, bold claim, or relatable problem statement
- **Interest**: Build curiosity; show why this matters specifically to *them*
- **Desire**: Paint the picture of life after solving the problem; show status/results
- **Action**: Make the next step crystal clear with a single, high-intent CTA
- *Best for*: Ad copy, short-form emails, product launch sequences

### BAB Framework (Before-After-Bridge)
- **Before**: Show the current, undesirable state (pain, frustration, missed opportunity)
- **After**: Show the desired outcome (success, relief, results achieved)
- **Bridge**: Explain how your offer closes the gap; be specific about *how* it works
- *Best for*: Sales pages, case studies, video scripts, testimonials

## Process

### 1. Gather Context
- Identify the target audience and their primary pain point
- Research competitor copy to understand positioning
- List 3-5 core benefits of your product/service
- Identify the emotional drivers (fear, gain, status, relief, belonging)
- Determine the reading level and tone match (professional, casual, urgent, warm)

### 2. Choose Your Framework
- **PAS**: Problem-heavy positioning; best for uncertain or skeptical audiences
- **AIDA**: Fast-moving, attention-demanding environments (ads, subject lines)
- **BAB**: Visual, aspirational messaging; works well for transformation products
- Mix frameworks: Use AIDA for the headline, BAB for body, PAS for objections

### 3. Write Copy
- **Lead with benefits, not features**: "Save 10 hours/week" beats "Includes automation tools"
- **Use "you" language**: Speak directly to the reader; avoid "we" in the opening
- **Write at 8th-grade reading level**: Use short sentences, simple words, active voice
- **Include specific numbers**: "3X faster" > "significantly faster"; "47 templates" > "many templates"
- **Front-load the payoff**: Put the biggest benefit in the first sentence or headline
- **Use power words**: Essential, proven, guaranteed, exclusive, limited, reveal, unlock, transform
- **Show before/after contrast**: "Spend hours debugging" → "Spot errors in seconds"
- **Add social proof tokens**: "Trusted by 50,000+ marketers" (specific number, specific audience)

### 4. Review & Optimize
- **Read aloud**: Does it flow? Do awkward phrases stand out?
- **Cut 20%**: Remove redundant words, weak adjectives, and filler
- **Check clarity**: Can a stranger understand the core benefit in 5 seconds?
- **Verify specificity**: Replace vague claims (amazing, best) with measurable proof
- **Test CTAs**: Is the call-to-action in first-person and outcome-focused? ("Get My Free Guide" vs. "Download")
- **Ensure alignment**: Does the tone match your brand and audience expectations?

## Copy Rules (Hard Constraints)

### Headline Rules
- Start with a benefit, problem, or curiosity gap
- Include numbers or specificity when possible
- Use 8-10 words as a target (headlines under 6 words lack context; over 12 words lose attention)
- Test power words: Why, How, What, New, Proven, Secret, Exclusive
- Always A/B test at least 3 headline variations

### CTA Optimization
- Use first-person action verbs: "Get," "Start," "Claim," "Unlock," "Reveal," "Join"
- Focus on the *outcome*, not the action: "Get My Free Checklist" not "Click Here"
- Create urgency if appropriate: "Claim Your Free Access Today"
- Size and contrast: CTAs should stand out; use high-contrast colors
- Placement: Lead with primary CTA after main benefit; repeat near bottom

### Benefit-Driven Writing Rules
- Every feature must answer "So what?" and map to a customer benefit
- Use the format: **Feature** → **Benefit** → **Outcome**
  - Example: *Integrates with Slack (feature) → Get instant alerts (benefit) → Never miss a critical message (outcome)*
- Write in customer language, not product language
- Avoid jargon; explain technical terms in simple words

### Tone Matching
- **Professional/Corporate**: Formal, data-driven, credibility-focused ("Leading solution," "Enterprise-grade")
- **Casual/Consumer**: Conversational, relatable, personality-driven ("We're obsessed with…," "Here's the deal")
- **Urgent/Promotional**: Action-oriented, scarcity-focused ("Limited spots," "Only today")
- **Warm/Supportive**: Empathetic, reassuring, permission-giving ("We get it," "You're not alone")
- Match your audience's communication preference and context
