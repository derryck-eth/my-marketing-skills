## Core Frameworks & Knowledge

### Campaign Structure & Hierarchy
- **Account Level**: All campaigns, settings, billing, conversion tracking
- **Campaign Level**: Budget, targeting (geography, devices), bidding strategy, ad schedule
- **Ad Group Level**: Keywords, placements, audiences, ads (typically 3-5 ads per group)
- **Ad/Keyword Level**: Individual ads, keyword match types, landing pages

### Google Ads Platforms
1. **Search Ads**: Text ads for intent-driven keywords
   - Auction-based on keyword relevance and quality score
   - Match types: Broad, Broad Match Modifier, Phrase, Exact

### Audience Targeting Models
1. **Cold Audiences**: Broad, in-market, interest-based (top of funnel)
2. **Warm Audiences**: Website visitors (1-180 days), email lists, past customers (mid funnel)
3. **Hot Audiences**: Cart abandoners, past purchasers, email engagers (bottom funnel)
4. **Lookalike Audiences**: 1% similar to 10% (start with 1% for highest relevance)

### Bidding Strategies
- **Manual CPC**: Full control, best for testing and learning
- **Target CPA**: AI sets bids to reach target cost per acquisition (requires 10+ conversions/week)
- **Target ROAS**: AI optimizes for return on ad spend (requires 20+ conversions/week, $50K+ spend)
- **Maximize Conversions**: Spend full budget to maximize conversions
- **Maximize Clicks**: Simple volume play, lowest quality typically

### Budget Allocation
- **Testing**: 10-15% of budget to new audiences/keywords/creatives
- **Performance**: 60-70% to proven, profitable campaigns
- **Scaling**: 15-20% to gradually increasing winners
- **Rule of Thumb**: Let campaigns run 100+ impressions, 15-30 clicks before assessment
- **Daily Budget**: Set at 30-50x target CPA to give algorithm learning room

### Ad Copy Best Practices
- **Headline (Google)**: Lead with benefit, include primary keyword, 30 characters
- **Description (Google)**: Unique value, social proof (if available), 90 characters each
- **Facebook Headlines**: 40 characters, brand name + benefit (e.g., "Acme: Save 3 Hours Daily")
- **Hook**: First line must stop scrolling (stat, question, pattern interrupt)
- **Structure**: Hook → Problem acknowledgment → Solution → CTA
- **AIDA Model**: Attention (hook) → Interest (benefit) → Desire (proof/specificity) → Action (CTA)

### Quality Score Factors (Google)
- **Ad Relevance**: Does ad match search query? (Keyword inclusion helps)
- **Landing Page Experience**: Load speed, mobile optimization, relevance, trust signals
- **CTR History**: Expected click-through rate for this keyword + ad combo
- **Improving Score**: Tighter keyword/ad alignment, faster pages, higher relevance

### A/B Testing Ads
- **Change One Variable**: Headline, description, CTA, audience, landing page, or creative
- **Sample Size**: 15-30 conversions minimum per variant for statistical significance
- **Statistical Significance**: Use 80/20 rule (winner must beat loser by 20%+) or p-value <0.05
- **Testing Timeline**: 1-4 weeks depending on volume; pause losing variants to save budget
- **Learnings**: Document winners by audience segment, campaign, season

### Retargeting & Remarketing
- **Pixel-Based**: Targets users who visited site (any page or specific behavior)
- **List-Based**: Upload email list, CRM data, or phone numbers (requires consent)
- **CTR Boost**: Retargeting audiences have 3-5x higher CTR than cold audiences
- **Frequency Cap**: 3-5 impressions per day to avoid ad fatigue
- **Segment Strategy**: Site visitors (7-day), abandoned carts (3-day), past customers (30-day)
- **Messaging**: Different copy for browser users vs. converters vs. high-value segment

### Negative Keywords & Exclusions
- **Exact Negatives**: Block exact keyword phrases wasting budget
- **Broad Negatives**: Block concept (e.g., "free" if you're premium)
- **Common Waste**: Misspellings, competitor names (if brand), low-intent modifiers
- **Review Search Terms**: Weekly review of search terms report (Google Ads) to find negatives
- **False Positives**: Be conservative; removing good keywords costs more than an extra bad click

### ROAS Optimization Progression
1. **Phase 1 (Learning)**: Launch campaigns, ensure tracking works, hit 30+ conversions/day
2. **Phase 2 (Exploration)**: Test audiences, creatives, messaging, identify 2-3 winners
3. **Phase 3 (Scaling)**: Increase budget 20-30% weekly on profitable segments
4. **Phase 4 (Optimization)**: Automate bidding (Target ROAS if possible), pause underperformers
5. **Phase 5 (Maintenance)**: Refresh creatives every 4-8 weeks, test new audiences quarterly

### Landing Page Alignment
- **Keyword to Ad to Page**: If ad mentions "blue widget," landing page must prominently feature it
- **Speed**: Mobile load time <3 seconds; desktop <2 seconds
- **Single Conversion Goal**: Remove competing CTAs; 1-2 forms max
- **Mobile-First**: 60%+ of traffic is mobile; single-column layout, large tap targets
- **Trust Signals**: Reviews, testimonials, money-back guarantee, security badges visible above fold

## Process (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Campaign Planning & Setup
- [ ] Define business goal: Leads, sales, app installs, or awareness
- [ ] Set daily budget, campaign duration, geographic targets
- [ ] Identify primary platforms (Google Search = sales intent, Meta = awareness/retargeting)
- [ ] Choose campaign objective aligned with funnel stage
- [ ] Enable conversion tracking: Set up Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel, or LinkedIn Insight Tag
- [ ] Create conversion actions in platform: Purchase, form submit, button click

### 2. Audience & Keyword Research
- [ ] Google Ads: Use Keyword Planner to find monthly volume, CPC, competition for 20-50 keywords
- [ ] Segment keywords by intent: Brand (buy now) vs. non-brand (learning)
- [ ] Meta: Identify primary audience (demographics, interests, behaviors)
- [ ] Create 3-5 audience segments by lifecycle stage: Awareness → Consideration → Conversion
- [ ] Set up warm audiences: Website visitors (15-30 day window), past customer list
- [ ] Compile negative keywords list (free, reviews, competitor names, etc.)

### 3. Ad Copy & Creative Development
- [ ] Google Search: Write 3 headlines + 2 descriptions per keyword (responsive ad format)
  - Headline 1: Primary benefit + keyword
  - Headline 2: Social proof or unique angle
  - Headline 3: CTA or urgency
- [ ] Facebook: Design 3-5 creative variants (different hooks, angles, formats)
  - Static image with benefit-driven copy
  - Carousel (4-6 cards, each highlighting product feature)
  - Video (15-30 sec, captions on)
- [ ] Landing page: Single, mobile-optimized page with matching headline, clear CTA, load time <3s

### 4. Campaign Build & Launch
- [ ] Google Ads:
  - Create campaign with daily budget (set conservatively for learning phase)
  - Create ad group for each keyword cluster (10-20 tightly related keywords per group)
  - Add keywords with match types: 3x Exact, 2x Phrase, 1x Broad Match Modifier (start narrow)
  - Add ad copy (use responsive search ads for automation)
  - Set bid: Use suggested bid or start with manual CPC at $1.00-$2.00 (adjust based on CPA goal)
  - Link landing page
- [ ] Meta Ads:
  - Create campaign with daily budget ($5-$10 minimum per audience segment to start)
  - Set campaign objective (Conversions recommended for measurable ROI)
  - Create audience: Narrow cold audience OR use warm audience (pixel visitors, email list)
  - Upload 3-5 creative variants, copy variations
  - Set daily budget, bid strategy (Lowest Cost recommended for learning)
  - Review placements; uncheck lower-performing channels (Audience Network, etc.)
  - Set schedule: Full-time or peak hours only (e.g., 8am-10pm)

### 5. Monitoring & Optimization (Days 1-30)
- [ ] Daily check: Conversion tracking firing correctly (check conversion pixel in DevTools)
- [ ] Daily budget monitoring: Stop campaigns wasting budget on low-intent traffic
- [ ] Weekly optimization:
  - Google Ads: Review search terms report, add 10-15 negatives
  - Pause keywords with >5 clicks, 0 conversions in first week
  - Google Ads: Increase bids on keywords with high quality score (7-10), conversions
  - Meta Ads: Identify top-performing creative, increase budget 10-20%
  - Pause creative with <2% click-through rate
- [ ] 2-Week Check (50-100 conversions minimum):
  - Assess campaign-level ROAS (revenue ÷ ad spend)
  - If ROAS <1:1, audit landing page (speed, relevance, mobile)
  - If ROAS >2:1, prepare to scale budget
  - Switch to Target CPA bidding (Google) if 20+ daily conversions achieved

### 6. A/B Testing & Scaling
- [ ] Split-test variables (one at a time):
  - Headlines: A = benefit-driven, B = urgency-driven
  - Landing pages: A = existing, B = simplified or social proof variant
  - Audiences: A = broad interest, B = narrow custom audience
- [ ] Run test for 2-4 weeks; ensure 20+ conversions per variant minimum
- [ ] Document results: winning variant, audience, creative, time period
- [ ] Scale winners: Increase budget 20-30% weekly, monitor ROAS does not degrade
- [ ] Pause losers once statistical confidence achieved (loser has <3% chance of winning)

### 7. Retargeting Implementation
- [ ] Set up retargeting audience: All site visitors (exclude converters)
- [ ] Create retargeting campaign with different message (address objections, social proof)
- [ ] Budget: Start with 10-15% of acquisition budget
- [ ] Set frequency cap: Max 3-5 impressions per person per day
- [ ] Monitor ROAS separately; retargeting typically 3-5x more efficient than cold traffic
- [ ] Segment retargeting by behavior: Cart abandoners (1-day, urgency), browsers (7-day, social proof)

### 8. Long-Term Optimization (Month 2+)
- [ ] Monthly creative refresh: Pause underperforming ads, test 2-3 new creative variants
- [ ] Seasonal campaigns: Prep campaigns for peak seasons (e.g., holiday Q4, back-to-school)
- [ ] Expand audiences: Test new interest targeting, lookalike audiences (start with 1%)
- [ ] Increase bids on top performers gradually while monitoring ROAS
- [ ] Platform expansion: If Google Search profitable, test Google Display, YouTube, Shopping
- [ ] Competitive analysis: Monitor competitor ad copy and landing pages quarterly; stay ahead
